* Updates
* Revert pbr

* That was from other project =P
* Empty dispatcher tests TODO
* Travis ci
* Added development requirements
* Added documentation
* When a queue does not exist and we launch multiple workers against it we could find a race condition on the table creation. As it does not really affect anything at all, we just ignore the exception
* Worker now handles table creation
* I like it better this way, job.work uses job's context manager, so deletion of the task is handled inside job itself
* Handle job deletion in the tests
* Tests for Worker class
* Added basic test for Worker()
* Added a basic test function to be used in tests. Not ideal, but fast
* It seems to be a bit clearer this way. This was implemented as an async context manager wich was an async iterator... but that, with a job queue, is not as clear as it could be
* Better syntax
* Added delete method
* We cant get an eventloop inside an eventloop
* Sleep two seconds each time the server gives a non-200 response
* Stop deleting stuff from the database, make it stateful. Also, rewrote workers so that dispatchers are themselves, wich looks cool
